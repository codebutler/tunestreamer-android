TuneStreamer for Android
========================

TuneStreamer is a music player for Android that allows you to remotely access your home music library from anywhere, and stream songs straight to your phone. It uses the Roku SoundBridge protocol (RSP), which is similar to Apple's [Digital Audio Access Protocol (DAAP)][daap] found in iTunes.

TuneStreamer has been tested with the following servers:

* [forked-daapd][forked-daapd] (Recommended. Ubuntu packages available [here][forked-daapd-packages].)
* [Firefly Media Server][firefly] (Not recommended.)
